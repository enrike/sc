        /s_new args : stringdefname, synth ID (nodeID), addaction, addtargetID, args:[controlindexorname, control value]
        Create a new synth from a synth definition, give it an ID, and add it to the tree of
        nodes. There are four ways to add the node to the tree as determined by the add action
        argument which is defined as follows:
        add actions:
        0 - add the new node to the the head of the group specified by the add target ID.
        1 - add the new node to the the tail of the group specified by the add target ID.
        2 - add the new node just before the node specified by the add target ID.
        3 - add the new node just after the node specified by the add target ID.
        4 - the new node replaces the node specified by the add target ID. The target node is
        freed.
        Controls may be set when creating the synth. The control arguments are the same as
        for the n_set command.
        If you send /s_new with a synth ID of -1, then the server will generate an ID for you.
        The server reserves all negative IDs. Since you don't know what the ID is, you cannot
        talk to this node directly later. So this is useful for nodes that are of finite duration
        and that get the control information they need from arguments and buses or messages
        directed to their group. In addition no notifications are sent when there are changes of
        state for this node, such as /go, /end, /on, /off.
        If you use a node ID of -1 for any other command, such as /n_map, then it refers to
        the most recently created node by /s_new (auto generated ID or not). This is how you
        can map the controls of a node with an auto generated ID. In a multi-client situation,
        the only way you can be sure what node -1 refers to is to put the messages in a bundle.
